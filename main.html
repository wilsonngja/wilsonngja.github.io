                <p class= "box_2">
                    My passion lies in programming but unlike just any programming, I find more joy in programming that resolves prevalent issues rather than just for commercial purposes. Examples are such as programs that can protect personal data. Apart from programming, I also love to play sports such as Table Tennis and Tchoukball.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I've committed in projects and one of which is a Data Visualisation project which I've done with CSIT. This projects has helped me to pick up knowledge out of my course such as Web Scraping and Data Cleaning.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Currently serving my national service as a Transport Operator (Service) in the Air force, I make use of my weekend to keep up with the digital trends and technology to better prepare me for my university.</p>
